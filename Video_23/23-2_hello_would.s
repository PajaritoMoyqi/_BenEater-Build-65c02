;  EEPROM(AT28C256) is mapped from 0x8000 to 0xFFFF. - to program a computer
;    Vector table: inm handler is mapped at 0xFFFA, init function is mapped at 0xFFFC, irq handler is mapped at 0xFFFE.
;  I/O controller(W65C22) is mapped from 0x6000 to 0x7FFF. - to make output data meaningful
;    I/O controller setting registers are mapped from 0x6000 to 0x600F.
;      All pins of port B is for data output when using LCD monitor connected.
;  RAM(HM62256B) is mapped from 0x0000 to 0x3FFF. - to get memory for stack(in W65C02S, stack has address from 0x0100 to 0x01FF)
;    Stack is mapped for 0x0100 to 0x01FF.

;  This code shows "Hello, would!".
;  The typo is intentional.
;
;  ยก Note that now we are using port B to transfer flag bits !
;  All pins of port B is connected to LCD monitor where PB0 to PB3 is connected to DB4 to DB7 of LCD monitor,
;  PB4 to RS, PB5 to RW and PB6 to E of LCD. I have no idea where PB7 is connected to.
